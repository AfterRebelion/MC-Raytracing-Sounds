# Sound-Physics
A Minecraft mod that provides realistic sound attenuation, reverberation, and absorption through blocks.

This is a fork of a fork of a fork! I forked it from djpabit who forked it from daipenger who forked it from sonicether, daipenger ported it to 1.12.2 and updated the mod, djpadbit added some cool stuff and I updated the mod to the latest version and compile it, maybe some other stuff we'll see.

The stuff added in this fork:
* Dynamic environement evaluation (disabled by default, enable in mod config ingame)
* Automatic stero to mono downmixing of sounds
* More compatibillity with mods (for now only computronics)
* latest Forge version

And that's pretty much it. yeah that's not a lot.
