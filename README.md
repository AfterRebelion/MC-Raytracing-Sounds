# Sound-Physics
A Minecraft mod that provides realistic sound attenuation, reverberation, and absorption through blocks.

This is a fork of a fork! I forked it from daipenger who forked it from sonicether, daipenger ported it to 1.12.2 and updated the mod, i just added some stuff.

The stuff added in this fork:
* Dynamic environement evaluation
* Automatic stero to mono downmixing of sounds
* More compatibillity with mods (for now only computronics)

And that's pretty much it. yeah that's not a lot.
